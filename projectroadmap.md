Currently there is one potentially strong blueprint that could be useful in the development of my project.

A crossword generation code named "genxword" by user "riverrun" which I have forked to my Github.

However, there are some aspects that pose immediate problems when viewing this example.

First, this code was developed 12 years ago.
This leaves potential that the code may be outdated and no long of use for the purposes of my assignment.

Second, the referenced example is a "crossword generator" instead of a set crossword puzzle.
It generates a random crossword puzzle from a list of hundreds of words in a randomized order. 
In my assignment, I am aiming to develop a single crossword puzzle that does not change.

Last, the reference has no "check" feature to verify if the filled out answers are correct.
This feature is something I am hoping to implement in my project.

Overall, while this example could provide a good starting point, if I am to use this as a reference I will have to make signifcant changes for my project.

I have found a very strong example that I think could be used as a blueprint for my project. 

The github file is called "crossword_generator" by user "gondsm."

The reason that I have identified this example as promising is because it only has 4 files that compose the code.
Each of these files is no more than 200 lines of length and they each seem to be realtively comprehensible.
The other examples that I was looking towards were much longer, more complex, and difficult to understand. 

I plan to use this example as a blueprint for now and hopefully I will not run into major problems.
