Currently there is one potentially strong blueprint that could be useful in the development of my project.

A crossword generation code named "genxword" by user "riverrun" which I have forked to my Github.

However, there are some aspects that pose immediate problems when viewing this example.

First, this code was developed 12 years ago.
This leaves potential that the code may be outdated and no long of use for the purposes of my assignment.

Second, the referenced example is a "crossword generator" instead of a set crossword puzzle.
It generates a random crossword puzzle from a list of hundreds of words in a randomized order. 
In my assignment, I am aiming to develop a single crossword puzzle that does not change.

Last, the reference has no "check" feature to verify if the filled out answers are correct.
This feature is something I am hoping to implement in my project.

Overall, while this example could provide a good starting point, if I am to use this as a reference I will have to make signifcant changes for my project.
